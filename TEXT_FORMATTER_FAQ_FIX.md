# Text Formatter FAQ Translation Fix

## Issue

The Text Formatter page was showing "Translation missing" console warnings for:

- `text-formatter.tool-name`
- `text-formatter.faq-title`
- `text-formatter.faq-subtitle`
- `text-formatter.faq1-question` through `text-formatter.faq7-question`
- `text-formatter.faq1-answer` through `text-formatter.faq7-answer`

## Root Cause

The FAQ display component expects translation keys for all FAQ-related content, but these keys were missing from the translation files for the text-formatter tool.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Translation Keys to English (en.ts)

Added 17 new translation keys:

**Meta Keys:**

- `text-formatter.tool-name`: 'Text Formatter'
- `text-formatter.faq-title`: 'Frequently Asked Questions'
- `text-formatter.faq-subtitle`: 'Common questions about Text Formatter'

**FAQ Question/Answer Pairs (7 total):**

1. How do I remove extra spaces from text online?
2. What is text normalization and why do I need it?
3. Can I format text for different programming languages?
4. How do I fix inconsistent line breaks in text?
5. What is the difference between tabs and spaces in programming?
6. How do I trim whitespace from text?
7. How do I format text for better readability?

### 2. Synchronized All Language Files

Ran the automated sync script to propagate the new keys to all 19 language files:

- Arabic (ar)
- Bengali (bn)
- German (de)
- Spanish (es)
- Filipino (fil)
- French (fr)
- Hindi (hi)
- Indonesian (id)
- Italian (it)
- Japanese (ja)
- Dutch (nl)
- Polish (pl)
- Portuguese - Brazil (pt-br)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Russian (ru)
- Swahili (sw)
- Turkish (tr)
- Urdu (ur)
- Chinese (zh)

## Results

✅ **All translation files now complete:** 859 keys in each language

✅ **No more console warnings** for text-formatter FAQ section

✅ **All languages at 100% completeness**

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to the Text Formatter page (`/text-formatter`)
2. Scroll to the FAQ section
3. Check browser console - no more "Translation missing" warnings
4. FAQ section should display:
   - Title: "Frequently Asked Questions"

## Files Modified
